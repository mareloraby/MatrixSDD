# MatrixSDD

SDD for a context-free grammar (CFG) that generates the set of all strings over the alphabet {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, #}. 
<be> The grammar is defined in the file A2.g4 under the grammars directory. The start variable has an attribute `check` whose value is 1 if the generated string represents a matrix of decimal digits where the sum of the first row is equal to the sum of the first column. Otherwise, the value of `check` is 0. 

A string over {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, #} represents a matrix of digits if it is of the form r1#r2#...#rn, where ri âˆˆ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}+ and |ri| = |rj|, for every 1<i, j<n.

The file A2Runner.java provides a class to generate and test individual strings that are generated by the grammar. The file A2Tests.java contains unit tests for the implementation. The method `sCheckValue` uses the ANTLR grammar to get the value of s.check for a given input string.

## Examples:

- The following matrix:
```
2 2 2
2 4 6
1 3 5
1 4 6
```
would be represented as `222#246#135#146` and `s.check` should return 1.

- While the matrix 
```
2 4 6 8 0
1 3 5 7 9
1 3 5 7 9
1 3 5 7 9
```
would be represented as `24680#13579#13579#13579` and `s.check` should return 0.

- The matrix 
```
2 2 2
2 4 6
1 3
1 4 6
```
would be represented as `222#246#13#146` and `s.check` should return 0 because the rows' lengths are not equal.

## Dependencies
This project uses ANTLR4 (version 4.9.3) to generate the parser and lexer for the grammar.
