# MatrixSDD

SDD for a context-free grammar which generates the set of all strings over the alphabet {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, #}. 

The grammar is defined in the file A2.g4 under the grammars directory. The start variable has an attribute `check` whose value is 1 if the generated string represents a matrix of decimal digits where the sum of the first row is equal to the sum of the first column. Otherwise, the value of `check` is 0. 

A string over {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, #} represents a matrix of digits if it is of the form r1#r2#...#rn, where ri âˆˆ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}+ and |ri| = |rj|, for every 1<i, j<n.

The file A2Runner.java provides a class to generate and test individual strings that are generated by the grammar. The file A2Tests.java contains unit tests for the implementation.

## Dependencies
This project uses ANTLR4 (version 4.9.3) to generate the parser and lexer for the grammar. The ANTLR4 runtime library is included in the lib directory.
